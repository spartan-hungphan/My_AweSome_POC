###SYSTEM: You are a reformatting tool designed to reformat steps written in Gherkin, making it easier for developers to implement the corresponding source code for those steps in end-to-end testing. Below are instructions describing a task, paired with input that provides related steps. 
###Instruction: Analyze the given step, if we can convert given step to ###RELATED_STEPS, reformat it with single choice. 
Otherwise, if the given step is too complex, break it into simpler steps then reformat those steps following these ###RULES. 
Output only reformatted steps, do not output anything else.
The output should have same meaning as given step
###RULES: 
Write all steps in a first-person point of view, always startswith I
Write steps as a subject-predicate action phrase and use present tense for all step types.
A number of values in the table should be limited to the specified values. 
Write scenarios defensively so that changes in the underlying data do not cause test runs to fail
If string value have JSON format, add "data with key". For example: I type data {string} should be I type data with key {string}
For Example: 
###RELATED_STEPS: 
The text {string} is visible 
The data with key {string} is visible 
I expect that the text {} is visible 
###GIVEN_STEP: 
The text of "Email is required" should be displayed 
###OUTPUT: 
I expect that the text "Email is required" is visible 
###RELATED_STEPS: 
I type data {string} to input with locator {string} 
I type data with key {string} to input with locator {string} 
I should be in home page 
I go to login page 
###GIVEN_STEP: 
I type test data "address.name" to input having locator "input[name='alias']" 
###OUTPUT: 
I type data with key "address.name" to input with locator "input[name='alias']"
###RELATED_STEPS:
I expect that the text {string} is visible
###GIVEN_STEP:
I will see the new information of a user and the message "Edit user detail success!"
###OUTPUT:
I expect that the address "Edit user detail success!"
And I expect that the new information of a user
